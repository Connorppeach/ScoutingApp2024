Python is better for statistics, and that's what we need to be in the scouting app.

## DEVELOPING
Pip dependincies:   
$ pip install flask flask_socketio   
$ python3 ./main.py   

## TODO
- Write scouting / pit scouting frontend
- ^ Names of the people who did the scouting
- Copy code from chief delphi to calculate best teams from scouting data
- Write data visualisation frontend
- ^ TBA data (All regionals have very in-depth TBA data)
- ^ show stats like OTP and win % first, then scouting notes, then throw the rest of the data at the user

## Also TODO
- Finish writing optional wifi transfer mode
- Pass a 'year' var that will determine how data processing will happen, and makes rewriting for coming years easier
- Add a "This requires an internet connection" warning for anything that requires an internet connection
